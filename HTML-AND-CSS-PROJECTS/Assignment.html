<blockquote cite="https://marvel.fandom.com/wiki/Amazing_Spider-Man_Vol_1_121.html"> "The Night Gwen Stacy Died"
In the previous issue Harry Osborn had taken LSD, which made him fall into a clinical Psychosis. This issue begins with Peter as Spider-Man now watching through their apartment window as Gwen Stacy and Mary Jane Watson are at Harry's bedside. The Osborn's family doctor Ray tells Gwen and Mary Jane that Harry has been taking drugs again. He gives Harry a shot of Thorazine, a tranquilizer to offset the effect of LSD. Spider-Man decides to do a quick change on the rooftop and go inside where he is then confronted by Norman Osborn.

Norman blames Peter for what has happened to Harry and later in this issue cracks under pressure returning to the Green Goblin persona.
