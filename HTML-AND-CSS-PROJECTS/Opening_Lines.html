	<h><span style="font-weight:bold"><font size=5>A Tale of Two Cities</font></span></h>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic"><font size=3>It was the best of times, it was the worst of times,<br>
	it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness,<br> 
	it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity,<br> 
	it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, <br>
	it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, <br>
	we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, <br>
	we were all going direct the other way—in short, the period was so far like the present period, <br>
	that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, <br>
	for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.”<br></span></font>

	<h><span style="font-weight:bold"><font size=5>Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas</font></span></h>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic"><font size=3>We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold.<br>
	I remember saying something like "I feel a bit lightheaded; maybe you should drive. . . ." <br>
	And suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats,<br>
	all swooping and screeching and diving around the car, which was going about a hundred miles an hour with <br>
	the top down to Las Vegas. And a voice was screaming "Holy Jesus! What are these goddamn animals?" <br></span></font>

	<h><span style="font-weight:bold"><font size=5>The Old Man &amp; the Sea</font></span></h>
	<p><span style="font-style:italic"><font size=3>He was an old man who fished alone in a skiff in the Gulf Stream and he had gone <br>
	eighty-four days now without taking a fish. In the first forty days a boy had been with him.<br>
	But after forty days without a fish the boy’s parents had told him<br> 
	that the old man was now definitely and finally<span style="font-style:normal"> salao</span>, <br>
	which is the worst form of unlucky, and the boy had gone at their orders in <br>
	another boat which caught three good fish the first week.<br></span></font>
